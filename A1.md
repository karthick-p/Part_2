First Application: ALLTrails Link to application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alltrails.alltrails&hl=en

Application Description:

AllTrails is an outdoor activities mobile application which helps people search nearby hiking locations, plan their trail and assist them in hiking with GPS enabled tracking feature. AllTrails acts as an online assistance to outdoors. Typically, With the acquisition of every user’s trail, application provides detailed information about the hiking spots like hiking experience, reviews about the location, photos of the location.

Why application was chosen and Buy in for user:

AllTrails looks more unique and significant to me because it uses the technology like GPS, Camera, itinerary planning, information sharing, graphical data analysis and connectivity, which helps the people to connect easily to the outdoors and make it simple to access the unknown location. Generally, hiker enthusiast approaches tour guide or hiking organization for details about hiking activities in nearby living location because the hiking locations are remote and information’s present in the internet are not precise and adequate. AllTrails provides information about the nearby hiking location details with information about directions, trail difficulty level and distance of the complete trail. With the technology of information sharing, it provides information’s like hiking experience, hiking location photos, elevation levels and weather updates frequently.

Technologies leveraged:

AllTrails uses Google login and Facebook login application interfaces for log in the application. For location access, it uses the location services api to search for nearby hiking location. Through Camera and audio recording api, application records audio and enables it to take photo. Position sensor api used for detecting the orientation of the phone. Data such as tracking the route, elevation level and distance covered fetched from the google maps api.

Application Strengths:

Strength of the AllTrails application are creating your own hiking route which overlays with the prescribed route and it provides graphical representation of user’s trip information by collecting the data such as distance covered, elevation levels, time took for hiking. Generally, hikers don’t have large community to discuss or share information about their hiking experience but AllTrails provides the platform for hiking community where user can follow any hiker in the AllTrails and user can save hiking photos and experience in his profile.

Weakness and Improvement suggestions:

AllTrails didn’t allow user to message directly to another hiker account which can be updated. Follow request was not generated which affects the user’s privacy. AllTrails uses facebook login api so application should provide facebook interface for check in and photos share ability. These features can be implemented which will improve the user friendliness of the application.

First Heuristic Evaluation: Visibility of system status

In this application, permissions for GPS, media and storage devices are asked in popup properly whenever new user signs in. Whenever trail begins and application is minimized, trail running time is displayed in the notification bar which satisfies the first heuristic evaluation properly.

Examples: a.	whenever new user log in, a notification is thrown for permission to access the device location. b.	Whenever new user log in and tries to press the “record” button, a notification is thrown for permission to access the media, storage device. c. Whenever user presses “record” button, timer getting displayed and “play” button turns into “pause” button. When “pause” button is pressed, application displays “Clear”, “Save” icon in the UI. Timer pauses and started blinking which gives much attention to the user. Second Heuristic Evaluation: Match between system and real world

In this application, labels and icons defined for the objects are very simple and easily understood. This application satisfies the second heuristic evaluation properly.

Examples: a.	Button labels used are very simple for user like “Explore”, “Plan”, “Record”, “History”, “Load map”. b.	Icons above the button labels used mostly are default icon labels like android location icon used for the “Load map” button. Third Heuristic Evaluation: Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors

When application disconnects from the GPS location through system settings and when user return backs to the application, a notification popup appears regarding GPS access disabled. In this case, a popup was thrown to recover from the error which make this heuristic implementation properly.

Second Application: MacroDroid – Device Automation 
Link to application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlosoft.macrodroid&hl=en

Application Description:

MacroDroid (Macros + android) is a device automation application which automates the functions of the application for the android platform. Basically, Application enables user to create macros for an automation event with three basic operations such as “Trigger”, Actions” and “Constraints”. “Trigger” is the event listener generated for the task. “Actions” is the event executer for the task. “Constraints” is the exclusion used before performing the “Actions”. If “Constraints” are met, then “Actions” cannot be executed.

Why application was chosen and Buy in for user:

Automation of the user events in the phone looks very innovative for me and application helps user to automate an event by defining the macro with three basic structures only. The settings of this application are configurable according to user’s choice. It has system log which records the activity performed from this application. Macros for each activity is well structured and defined with the extensive user interface. Also, there are many pre-defined macro templates available in forums in which user can use it for many common tasks.

Technologies leveraged:

MacroDroid comes under the productivity type of application because this application acts as a tool for automating the task based on the macros defined by the user. Application uses “accessibility services” where user events trigger, event scheduler, event listener of any activity through appropriate call back methods are handled.

Application Strengths:

Strength of the MacroDroid is the automation of the simple and repetitive task which reduces human efforts. UI is well defined to define the macros. With large number of users sharing the macros in the forums, user find this application very easy to automate some common tasks like “Find the phone”, “Auto switch off”.

Application Weakness:

Application works on very high-level structure. Only people who has some basic knowledge of macros can define the tasks, though easy to learn. Application needs root permission to perform some task like “GPS On/Off”. Root access permission to the application looks dangerous.

Improvement Suggestions:

UI can be levelled up for general users hence instead of “macros” in the user interface, it can be of “tasks” and “macros” can be defined internally based on the task assigned. User accounts must be available to log in this application since this application have “dangerous” level of permissions.

First Heuristic Evaluation: User control and freedom

Application provides complete control to the user. For every event, user can able to switch to the previous screen easily and while adding each task events, user has the control of deleting the tasks. For example, when user presses “Delete” icon, application throws popup with message “Are you sure you wish to delete this macro?” with “CANCEL” and “OK” button. On press of “CANCEL” button, popup closes. In this case, with the help of “CANCEL” button, user came back to the previous screen.

Second Heuristic Evaluation: Visibility of system status

Permission accesses for this application are very high and permission notifications asked through popup properly for the first time. But application didn’t implement this heuristic completely since user doesn’t know when the task is automated and an information about the recently completed automation task should be notified in the notification bar.

Third Heuristic Evaluation: Match between system and real world

Button labels used are very simple for user like “Templates”, “Settings”, “Forum”. Icons above the button labels used mostly are default icon labels like “+” icon used for the “Add Macro” button. In this application, second heuristics is implemented properly.
